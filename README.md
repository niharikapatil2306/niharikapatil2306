# Hii, I’m Niharika Patil! 👋

I’m a **Machine Learning enthusiast** and a **full-stack developer** pursuing an MSc in Machine Learning in Science at the University of Nottingham, UK. I love crafting **interactive, user-friendly applications**. My passion lies at the intersection of code, AI, and great user experiences.

## 🔧 What I Work With
- **Languages**: JavaScript (ES6+), Python, Java, HTML/CSS
- **Frameworks & Tools**: React, React Router, Electron.js, Vite, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, React Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore), AWS (SageMaker, Rekognition, Lex)
- **Dev Essentials**: Node.js, npm/yarn, Git

## 📝 Blog Snippets 🖋️
I scribble about tech sometimes! Check out:  
- *Statistics Part 1 — Variables* 📊: Breaking down ML basics.  
- *React-Django QuickStart* ⚛️: Tips on TailwindCSS, React-Bootstrap, and more!

## Fun Fact
I built a pastry shop website partly because I’m obsessed with desserts—coding and sweets are my ultimate duo!
